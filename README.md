# Trello Clone UI

A small **React + TypeScript + Vite** project that replicates the core UI and interactions of Trello — including boards, lists, and draggable cards.  
This project was created for learning and practicing modern frontend development patterns.

## Features

- Create multiple boards
- Add lists and cards
- Drag and drop cards between lists using smooth animations
- Clean and modular component structure

## Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript**
- **Vite** (development server and build tool)
- **pnpm** for package management (works with npm/yarn too)
- **@hello-pangea/dnd** for drag-and-drop interactions
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (depending on your implementation)

## Notes

- This project focuses on the **frontend UI** only — there is no backend or database integration.  

## Enhancements / TODO (ideas)

- Connect to a backend (e.g., Supabase, Firebase) for persistent data
- Add user authentication
- Add comments, labels, and due dates to cards
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add unit/integration tests for drag-and-drop and component logic
- Add screenshots or demo GIFs to this README
